# Heimdall

Heimdall is a simple library that keeps your data secure through signing and verification written by Golang.

## Getting Started with Heimdall

### Installation

```
go get -u github.com/it-chain/heimdall
```

### Usage

```Go
// Get a new Crypto object
// Generated keys will be saved under "./.myKeys/.keys"
cyrpto := NewCryptoImpl(".myKeys", &RSAKeyGenOpts{})

// Sign the data to be transmitted by RSA / ECDSA
// Keys are automatically generated by KeyGenerator
signature, _ : = crypto.Sign(rawData, &RSASigner{})

// Loads both private and public keys
// If the keys do not exist, KeyGenerator automatically generates a pair of keys
priv, pub, _ := crypto.GetKey()

// Verify the received signature and digest data by public key
ok, _ := crypto.Verify(pub, signature, digest, &RSASigner{})
```

## Features 

### Asymmetric key algorithms
Currently, only the following algorithms are supported. But, We will provide more options to extend selection range.
- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA)
- [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDSA)

### Default key storage path
If you input empty path such as "", we store a pair of the key in below location.

```
heimdall/.keyReposiotry
```
